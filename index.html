  <p><strong>Roh Moo-hyun</strong> (Korean: <strong><u>노무현</u></strong>;
    Hanja: 盧武鉉; RR: No Muhyeon; Korean pronunciation: [no muçʌn]) GOM
    (1 September 1946 – 23 May 2009) was a South Korean politician who served as
    President of South Korea (2003–2008). Roh's pre-presidential political career
    was focused on human rights advocacy for student activists in South Korea.
    His electoral career later expanded to a focus on overcoming regionalism in
    South Korean politics, culminating in his election to the presidency.
    He achieved a large following among younger internet users, particularly at
    the website OhMyNews, which aided his success in the presidential election.</p>
